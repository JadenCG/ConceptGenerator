# About The Project

	A common issue I face when practicing sketching is gathering inspiration. While tools exist online, the full
	potential is typically unrealized. Alternatively, I would like to create a project to assist with learning C++.
	
	If you have come seeking a high-quality alternative to online concept generators, keep searching!
	Otherwise, I encourage other developers to clone and modify this project as they see fit. The project is thoroughly
	documented to assist with those learning the language or software practices.
